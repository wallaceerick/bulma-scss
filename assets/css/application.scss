// We are following a pattern called ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS).
// The concept is based mainly around layering on styles based on their reach within
// the DOM. We are also using this in combination of BEM and name spacing.

// Settings: Global variables, config and colors definitions.
@import "settings/functions",
		"settings/colors",
		"settings/screens",
		"settings/fonts";

// Tools: Libraries, mixins and functions.
@import "tools/bourbon",
		"tools/mixins",
		"tools/animations",
		"tools/controls";

// Generic: Ground-zero styles (normalize, reset, helpers and generics).
@import "generic/reset",
		"generic/helpers";
		// OK

// Elements: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
//@import "elements/headings";

// Objects: Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns.
@import "objects/columns",
		"objects/tiles",
		"objects/hero",
		"objects/header",
		"objects/sidebar",
		"objects/section",
		"objects/footer";
		// OK

// Components: Designed components, chunks of UI.
@import "components/box",
		"components/button",
		"components/content",
		"components/form",
		"components/icon",
		"components/image",
		"components/notification",
		"components/progress",
		"components/table",
		"components/tag",
		"components/title",
		"components/other",
		"components/card",
		"components/level",
		"components/media",
		"components/menu",
		"components/message",
		"components/modal",
		"components/nav",
		"components/pagination",
		"components/panel",
		"components/tabs";
		// OK

// Trumps: Utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle.
@import "trumps/overrides";
		// OK
