// We are following a pattern called ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS).
// The concept is based mainly around layering on styles based on their reach within
// the DOM. We are also using this in combination of BEM and name spacing.

// Settings: Global variables, config and colors definitions.
@import "settings/functions",
		"settings/colors",
		"settings/screens",
		"settings/miscellaneous",
		"settings/typography";

// Tools: Libraries, mixins and functions.
@import "tools/bourbon",
		"tools/mixins",
		"tools/animations",
		"tools/controls";

// Generic: Ground-zero styles (normalize, reset, helpers and generics).
@import "generic/reset",
		"generic/helpers";

// Elements: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
@import "elements/code",
		"elements/hr",
		"elements/links";

// Objects: Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns.
@import "objects/columns",
		"objects/container",
		"objects/tiles",
		"objects/hero",
		"objects/header",
		"objects/content",
		"objects/sidebar",
		"objects/section",

// Components: Designed components, chunks of UI.
@import "components/box",
